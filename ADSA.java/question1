A prefix sum array stores the cumulative sum of elements up to each index in a given array. This allows for efficient calculation of sums of subarrays, making it a valuable tool in various applications like range queries and dynamic programming. 
What is a Prefix Sum Array?
A prefix sum array, also called a cumulative sum array, is created from an original array by calculating the sum of all elements from the beginning of the array up to each index. Each element in the prefix sum array represents the sum of all elements in the original array up to that corresponding index. 
How to Construct a Prefix Sum Array:
1. Initialization:
Create a new array of the same size as the original array to hold the prefix sums.
2. Iteration:
Iterate through the original array, starting from the first element.
3. Cumulative Sum:
For each element, add its value to the sum of all previous elements, which is the value in the prefix sum array at the previous index.
4. Assignment:
Store the calculated cumulative sum in the prefix sum array at the corresponding index.
